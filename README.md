# Simple blog and publishing engine for ASP.NET Core 3.1
# Work in progress!

## I will not be accepting any PRs at the moment!

A full-featured multi-user yet simple blog engine built on ASP.NET Core 3.1.

## Requirements
* ASP.NET Core
  * SDK 3.1.100 or higher, or
  * Runtime 3.1.0 or higher
* Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code

Note: Uses the new Library Manager in VS2019 to download CSS and JavaScript libraries

## What works at the moment?
* Signing in and 
* List demo posts and settings
* Showing users
* Ading users (only if admin)
* Adding and editing posts/pages
  * Categories do not work
  * Post/page settings needs some updates to GUI
* Showing posts/pages
* Showing comments on posts
* Upload images or other files
  * Handling of uploaded images and files

Note: At the moment, users (that are not admins) can edit other users posts/pages.

## Users
